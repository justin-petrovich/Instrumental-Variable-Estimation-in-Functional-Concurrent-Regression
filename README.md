# Instrumental-Variable-Estimation-in-Functional-Concurrent-Regression: An Application to Labor Supply Elasticities

R files, including data, scripts for analysis, and simulations for the above paper are included here.

Note: The pre-cleaned data file was too large for upload, so only the cleaned data file is contained in the Data Analysis folder. This means that the Data Cleaning.R script cannot be run, but that the resulting data is included, which is all that is required for the remainder of the analysis. The pre-cleaned data can be provided upon request.
